# TOEFL-Modder

### Background

Mr. Cai, a student at Westlake University, is facing the TOEFL exam and feeling overwhelmed by the lack of effective English learning resources. Existing resources are limited, filled with advertisements, and lack a comprehensive approach. As his friends, we want to create an interactive English learning software that is tailored to Westlake University students, helping them improve their English skills anytime, anywhere. Our goal is to support Mr. Cai and other students in conquering the challenges of the TOEFL exam while uncovering its true nature.

### Software Design 
TOEFL-Modder is built using the most popular PC software development technologies and frameworks:
- Electron: A framework that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications
- Vue: A progressive JavaScript framework that simplifies the development of user interfaces
- Vite: A build tool for web applications that offers fast development and optimized production builds
- Naive UI: A Vue-based UI library that provides a set of customizable components for building desktop applications
- SQLite: A lightweight, serverless, self-contained, and embeddable database engine
